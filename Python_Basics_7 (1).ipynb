    "## 22.How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following: &#39;Alice eats apples.&#39;&#39;Bob pets cats.&#39;&#39;Carol throws baseballs.&#39;&#39;Alice throws Apples.&#39;&#39;BOB EATS CATS.&#39;but not the following:&#39;RoboCop eats apples.&#39;&#39;ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.&#39; &#39;Carol eats 7 cats.&#39;"
