    "Using logging messages is generally better than using print() statements to display messages for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flexibility: \n",
    "The logging module provides a lot of flexibility in how messages are captured and handled, which can be useful in complex programs. For example, you can configure the logging module to write messages to a file, send them over a network, or filter them based on severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Granularity:\n",
    "The logging module provides several levels of message severity (debug, info, warning, error, and critical), which allows you to capture and handle different types of messages differently. This can be helpful when debugging, as it allows you to focus on the most important messages first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration with other libraries: \n",
    "Many Python libraries use the logging module for their own messages, so using logging messages can make it easier to integrate your code with other libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance: \n",
    "The logging module is designed to be efficient and low-overhead, which means that it can capture and handle messages with minimal impact on performance. In contrast, using print() statements can add unnecessary overhead to your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintenance:\n",
    "Using logging messages can make your code easier to maintain and debug in the long run. Since logging messages are captured and handled in a separate module, they are less likely to clutter your code and make it harder to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, using logging messages is a more flexible, powerful, and maintainable way to capture and handle messages in Python programs, compared to using print() statements.\n",

    "The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons are common debugging commands found in most integrated development environments (IDEs) that support debugging. These buttons allow developers to control the flow of execution of their code during debugging. Here are the differences between the three buttons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Over: The Step Over button allows you to execute the current line of code, without stepping into any functions or methods that may be called on that line. If the current line contains a function or method call, the function will be executed, but the debugger will not stop inside the function. Instead, it will move to the next line of code after the function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step In: The Step In button allows you to execute the current line of code and step into any functions or methods that may be called on that line. If the current line contains a function or method call, the debugger will stop at the first line of the function or method, allowing you to step through the code inside that function or method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Out: The Step Out button allows you to step out of the current function or method that you are debugging and return to the calling function or method. If you are currently debugging a function or method, and you want to return to the caller without stepping through the remaining lines of code in the current function, you can use the Step Out button to do so.\n",
