    "RGBA stands for Red Green Blue Alpha. It is a color model used in digital imaging and computer graphics that describes how colors are composed of varying intensities of red, green, and blue light, as well as an additional alpha channel that represents the level of transparency or opacity of the color. The alpha channel is represented as a value between 0 and 1, with 0 representing full transparency and 1 representing full opacity. The RGBA color model is widely used in web design, computer gaming, and other digital applications where color and transparency are important"
